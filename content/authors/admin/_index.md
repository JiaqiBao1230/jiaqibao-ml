I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the Graduate School of Information Science and Technology at The University of Hokkaido and a member of the Laboratory for Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, supervised by Prof. Mineichi Kudo. Before this, I received an M.Eng. degree from Shenzhen University under the supervision of Prof. Zhihui Lai. I received a B.Eng. degree from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications Science and Technology. 

My research interests focus on the theories and algorithms of machine learning. Most recently, I am focusing on
semi-supervised learning, transfer learning, multi-label learning, and partial multi-label learning.
